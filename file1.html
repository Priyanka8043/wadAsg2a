    Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a 
    project simultaneously. It keeps track of changes made to files, enabling developers to work on 
    different features or branches independently and then merge their changes seamlessly. 
    Git tracks the entire history of a project, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if
    needed. It also facilitates branching and merging, making it easy to experiment with new features
    or fix bugs without affecting the main codebase.

    GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform built around Git. 
    It provides hosting services for Git repositories and offers additional features for 
    collaboration, such as issue tracking, pull requests, code review, and project management tools. 
    GitHub allows developers to share their code with others, contribute to open-source projects, 
    and showcase their work to potential employers or collaborators. It has become one of the most 
    popular platforms for hosting and sharing code, fostering a vibrant community of developers 
    worldwide.
